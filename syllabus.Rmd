### Course information

Prerequisites, if any: None, though some knowledge and practice of
Python may be useful. 

#### Course description

This course will will explore the world of data visualization and Python
tools to create these visualizations. Data visualization involves making
choices in how to visually encode different aspects of data (or
aggregated or transformed data) into aesthetics like points, lines,
colors, shapes and sizes, along with creating overlays or split graphics
based on some other data attribute. We will explore some principles of
creating data visualizations, exploring what makes a data visualization
a good or bad one. We will learn a bit of Python, enough to be able to
create visualizations from data stored in a `pandas` `DataFrame`. We
will explore three prominent Python packages (among many) to make static
and dynamic graphics, each of which expresses visual encodings in a
slightly different way. This exploration will be through examples of
exploratory graphics, graphical representations of modeling results, and
some specialized graphics for geospatial representations and
bioinformatics. Given the power of the web as a medium for information
exchange, we will be using Jupyter notebooks, a web-based notebook
format, to write Python code, see results, and create reports; two of
the packages we will explore are meant for web browsers rather than
print, though we will also cover how to create and save graphics meant
for print. We will culminate with a term project that will be a Jupyter
notebook visually exploring a data set of your choice, preferably one
applicable to your day-to-day work.

#### Course materials

All course materials (lectures, videos, homework, discussions) will be
available on the class
[Canvas](https://faes.instructure.com){target="_blank"} site. Some
readings and supplemental materials will be freely available on the web.

#### Learning Materials

Required and Recommended Texts: There are no required texts for this
class. However, the following texts, freely available online, will be
used for reference:

1.  *Python Data Science Handbook* [PDSH] by Jake VanderPlas (available
    [online](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/){target="_blank"})
2.  *Principles of Data Visualization* [PDV] by Claus O. Wilke
    (available
    [online](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/index.html){target="_blank"})

Required Journal Articles: There are no required journal articles for
this class

Other resources: A resources page will be available on Canvas that
provides links to various useful online material that can serve as
reference material as you explore data visualizations using Python.

#### Course Goals

When you complete the course successfully, you will be able to:

-   Understand principles of good data visualization; avoid poor or
    inappropriate data visualization
-   Use Python to ingest data and manipulate it to enable good
    visualizations
-   Appropriately use visual encodings like color, symbols, size and
    small multiples to express data
-   Create static (for print) and dynamic (for the web) data
    visualizations
-   Use the web as a presentation medium

#### Structure of the course

This course will run for 7 weeks. Of these, there will be instructional
material, including videos, lectures, slides, discussion, tutorials and
homework, for 6 of the weeks. The seventh week will be dedicated to a
culminating project that will be submitted by the end of the seventh
week. Your grade will be determined by class participation, i.e.,
discussions & Slack participation (25%), homework assignments (50%) and
the final project (25%).

#### The Learning Process

I believe in teaching practical methods for using Python as a tool in
achieving informative data-driven visualizations. As such, this course
is opinionated, in that I make certain choices of what parts of Python
to teach to make things most accessible and useful, and which parts I'll
gloss over. **This is not a course to learn Python**. The course will be
a mixture of didactic lessons, interactive tutorials and exercises,
culminating in a final project that brings different aspects of the
course together into a single dashboard.

Python is a tool to be used, not studied, and so I promote active
learning by doing in order to become familiar with Python, its
advantages and disadvantages, and using Python regularly through the
course to learn its capabilities to visualize data. Students will be
expected to create visualizations on web notebooks to show their data
story from the first day, thus learning how to apply their learning to
their own workflows and work environments.

Methods for students to achieve success

1.  Practice programming and coding with Python as much as possible
2.  See high quality online examples provided by members of the Python
    community and learn
3.  Participate in class discussions on Slack
4.  Determine a target visualization they would like to create for
    presentation to their labs and work towards creating that.

**Time commitment:** Daily practice for even 30 minutes is good, but for
particular class work I don't expect more than a couple of hours a week.

This course should take around 4-6 hours of time weekly, depending on
the week.

#### Communication

This class will communicate primarily via Slack. You will see a channel
`#spring2021-b`. Please ask to join this channel (as it is a private
channel). Please use Slack for broadcasting messages, answering
questions and the like. When you ask a question, please ask it under the
`#general` or `#spring2021-b` channels, so others can learn as well. I
should respond within 24 hours.

The Canvas Discussion forum will be used for guided class discussions.

#### Etiquette

The most important thing is to be polite, considerate and empathetic in
all communications and discussions. There are different levels of
knowledge about Python in this class, and so some questions may appear
trivial to some but are essential for others. Be kind, and if you can
help a classmate, do so with grace and civility. The class learns best
if we all help and support each other.

### Policies

homework in a timely manner. Since this course is completely
asynchronous, there is no attendance required at particular times.

#### Participation

Participation will be judged through the assigned discussions as well as
through activity on Slack.

#### Assignment Submission

Assignment submission is through Canvas. Each submission will consist of
a Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb), except for Assignment 1.

#### Due Dates

Homework is assigned at 10am each Monday and is due by 11:59pm the
following Sunday. . No assignments will be accepted, since solutions
will be published the following Monday. There will be 6 homework, and
the lowest 2 scores will be dropped for final grade calculations.

#### Late Submission Policies

No late submissions of homework or discussion are allowed beyond the
grace period. However, for homework, I will only use the top 4 scores
for your grade, so you will have the option of not submitting or doing
poorly on 2 of them.

#### Step-by-Step Guidelines for Submitting Assignments:

The guidelines for submitting assignments will be posted as a screencast
during the first week of class.

#### Expectations for instructor's feedback on assignments:

We will get your assignment grades and feedback to you within a week of
submission.

#### Major Assignments

Grades will be based on the following requirements:

1.  Homework for each week are due Sunday at 11:59pm (50%)

    -   No late homeworks
    -   We'll have 6 homeworks, I'll score the top 4 for grade

2.  Final project: A Python-based Jupyter notebook showing data
    visualizations(25%)

3.  Class participation (25%): Discussion topics in weeks 2-6, and
    participation in Slack.
