    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework must be done on a Jupyter notebook, either through JupyterLab or Notebook. The submission will consist of **2 files**; both files are required for complete submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The homework will be provided as a `ipynb` file, to be opened in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook. This file must be edited to include required code, run within the _biof440_ environment to produce outputs for code, and submitted.\n",
    "1. The final `ipynb` file, after all your work is done, must be converted to a HTML file using `File > Export Notebook As...` in JupyterLab or `File > Download as..` in Jupyter Notebook. Check that this HTML file contains all the outputs required from the assignment. This file needs to be submitted as well.\n",
    "1. Please submit both files using the naming convention `BIOF440_HW2_Lastname.ipynb` and `BIOF440_HW2_Lastname.html`, replacing \"Lastname\" with your last name/surname/family name.\n",

    "For this class, please create a folder named `BIOF440` on your computer where all the material will reside, and within that folder create a sub-folder named `data` where you will store data sets used in class. All your deliverables should be written in the `BIOF440` folder, so that your code will be consistent with mine in terms of reading data, and will make my life correcting your homework more reasonable. If I have to go through hoops to try and run your notebook to reproduce your homework, I will deduct **5 points** from the homework. To this end, **ensure that you're running the Jupyter notebook using the biof440 environment, so that we don't have issues with packages not being installed**. \n",

    "Each full question is **30 points**. You will get full credit if all the parts are done correctly. Extra credit problems will allow you to have a score of more than 100% for this homework.\n",
