BIOF 440: Data Visualization using Python
================

## Instructor: Abhijit Dasgupta, PhD

### Course description

This course will provide a short introduction to the
[Python](http://www.python.org) programming language, and then expose
students to different packages in the Python ecosystem that create both
static and dynamic data visualizations. During this exploration,
students will explore what makes a graph “good”, and what can make it
“bad”.

Students will be expected to do at-home studying and complete class
assignments in preparation for subsequent classes. This will be a rather
intense 7-week course. Students can also work together to facilitate
understanding, and share questions and answers on the class [Slack
channel](https://biof440.slack.com).

We will be using the [Anaconda Python
distribution](https://www.anaconda.com)

Grades are based on completing homework, class participation, and a
final presentation based on your own data and your own work, showing how
you can use data visualizations to help express the (scientific) story.
