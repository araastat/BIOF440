### Course information

Prerequisites, if any: None

#### Course description

This course will demonstrate and practice the use of R in creating and
presenting data visualizations. After a short introduction to R tools,
especially the tidyverse packages, we will look at good principles for
data visualization, examples of good and bad visualizations, and the use
of ggplot2 to create static publication-quality graphs. We will also
explore modern web-based interactive graphics using the htmlwidgets
packages as well as dynamic graphics and dashboards that can be created
using flexdashboard and Shiny. We will explore ways in which
bioinformatics data can be presented using static and dynamic
visualizations. Finally, we will use RMarkdown and several packages to
develop web pages for presenting data visualizations as
self-explanatory, and possibly interactive, storyboards.

#### Course materials

All course materials (lectures, videos, homework, discussions) will be
available on the class [Canvas](https://faes.instructure.com) site.

#### Learning Materials

#### Course Goals

When you complete the course successfully, you will be able to:

  - Understand principles of good data visualization; avoid poor or
    inappropriate data visualization
  - Practical short introduction to R to enable data visualization;
    Manipulating data to enable good visualizations
  - Appropriate use of color, symbols and small multiples
  - Static and dynamic data visualizations
  - Using the web as a presentation medium

#### Structure of the course

This course will run for 7 weeks. Of these, there will be instructional
material, including videos, lectures, slides, discussion, tutorials and
homework, for 6 of the weeks. The seventh week will be dedicated to a
culminating project that will be submitted by the end of the seventh
week. Your grade will be determined by class participation, i.e.,
discussions & Slack participation (30%), homework assignments (50%) and
the final project (20%).

#### The Learning Process

I believe in teaching practical methods for using R as a tool in
achieving informative data-driven visualizations. As such, this course
is opinionated, in that I make certain choices of what parts of R to
teach to make things most accessible and useful. The course will be a
mixture of didactic lessons, interactive tutorials and exercises,
culminating in a final project that brings different aspects of the
course together into a single dashboard.

R is a tool to be used, not studied, and so I promote active learning by
doing in order to become familiar with R, its advantages and
disadvantages, and using R regularly through the course to learn its
capabilities to visualize data. Students will be expected to create
simple dashboards to show their data story from the first day, thus
learning how to apply their learning to their own workflows and work
environments.

Methods for students to achieve success

1.  Practice programming and coding with R
2.  See high quality online examples provided by members of the R
    community and learn
3.  Participate in class discussions on Slack
4.  Determine a target visualization they would like to create for
    presentation to their labs and work towards creating that.

Time commitment Daily practice for even 30 minutes is good, but for
particular class work I don’t expect more than a couple of hours a week.

Students can be successful in this course through following the teaching
materials, participating in discussions on Slack, and practice. R is a
language in the same way that French or Japanese is a language (you’re
just talking to a computer), and so the only way to retain the knowledge
gained in this class is to use it. The exercises and tutorials are meant
to get you used to using R for different purposes, so please do them
diligently.

This course should take around 4-6 hours of time weekly, depending on
the week.

#### Communication

This class will communicate primarily via Slack. You will see a channel
`#fall2020-b`. Please join this channel. Please use Slack for
broadcasting messages, answering questions and the like. When you ask a
question, please ask it under the `#general` or `#fall2020-b` channels,
so others can learn as well. I should respond within 24 hours.

The Canvas Discussion forum will be used for guided class discussions.

#### Etiquette

The most important thing is to be polite, considerate and empathetic in
all communications and discussions. There are different levels of
knowledge about R in this class, and so some questions may appear
trivial to some but are essential for others. Be kind, and if you can
help a classmate, do so with grace and civility. The class learns best
if we all help and support each other.

### Policies

#### Attendance

It is in your best interest to use, utilize, question and understand all
the instructional material provided, and to submit questions and
homework in a timely manner. Since this course is completely
asynchronous, there is no attendance required at particular times.

#### Participation

Participation will be judged through the assigned discussions as well as
through activity on Slack.

#### Assignment Submission

Assignment submission is through Canvas. Each submission will consist of
a R Markdown file and the corresponding HTML file. **Both are
required**. Just submitting the R Markdown doesn’t let us see the
results easily, and just submitting the HTML doesn’t let us evaluate
your code. If you have trouble knitting the R Markdown to HTML, let me
know and I can help. If it’s really impossible and you’re tearing your
hair out, reach out to me at least by Saturday so I can see if (a) I can
help, or (b) I can see if reasonable accommodation can be made. The
latter will be a rarity, generally.

#### Due Dates

Homework is assigned at 10am each Monday and is due by 11:59pm the
following Sunday.

#### Late Submission Policies

No late submissions of homework or discussion are allowed. However, for
homework, I will only use the top 4 scores for your grade, so you will
have the option of not submitting or doing poorly on 2 of them.

#### Step-by-Step Guidelines for Submitting Assignments:

The guidelines for submitting assignments will be posted as a screencast
during the first week of class.

#### Expectations for instructor’s feedback on assignments:

We will get your assignment grades and feedback to you within a week of
submission.

#### Major Assignments

Grades will be based on the following requirements:

1.  Homeworks for each week are due Sunday at 11:59pm (50%)
      - No late homeworks
      - We’ll have 6 homeworks, I’ll score the top 4 for grade
2.  Final project: A R Markdown report/presentation demonstrating an
    end-to-end data analysis in R using your own data, from data
    ingestion to munging to analyses and graphics, with a brief
    introduction and conclusion (30%)
3.  Class participation (20%): Discussion topics in weeks 2-6

**Final project**

  - Create a R Markdown document or presentation
  - Use your own data, or data available on the web (legally)
  - Show me that you can
      - import data into R
      - manipulate (munge) the data
      - perform some analysis on the data
      - create a visualization
      - create a report in R Markdown
  - 5 minute lightning talks that can be recorded using Quicktime or
    [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com), which requires the
    Chrome browser
