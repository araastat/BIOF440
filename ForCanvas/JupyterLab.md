# JupyterLab

JupyterLab is a computational environment that runs in a web-browser on your computer that can run Python, R and other computer languages. 

First, open Anaconda Navigator.

Make sure that the section on top says that you're using Applications on biof440

Then you click on the **Launch** button in the tile for JupyterLab. Use the default version. 

This will open the following window on your default web browser.

Select **Python 3**. 

You might also get the following window

Click on the **Python 3** tile under **Notebook** to get to the window from earlier. 

#### Work folder

The JupyterLab environment opens in your HOME folder, whereever that is assigned on your computer. It's probably a good thing to create a folder specifically for BIOF 440. To do this, click the new folder icon above the file explorer on the left, and then create a new folder called **BIOF440**.

Double click on the new folder and then open a new Notebook by clicking the blue `+` button.

## Using JupyterLab

The basic idea in JupyterLab is that you can create Python cells and Markdown cells (for text). You put code in the Python cells and run them, and the results are put in the notebook. We will use this to run data visualizations and see them in the notebook. See the lecture videos to see how I use the notebook.
