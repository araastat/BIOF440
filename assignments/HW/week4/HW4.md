As usual, you will create a Jupyter notebook and submit both the ipynb file and the notebook exported as HTML. Both are required for a complete submission.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world. Inspired by this page (Links to an external site.) in the Financial Times, we'll create some dynamic visualizations using the covid2021.csv data.

1. Death trajectories
    A. Compute the top 10 countries in terms of total deaths from COVID-19. 
    B. Use Plotly to plot the trajectory of daily deaths over time for these countries
    C. Use Plotly to plot the trajectory of cumulative deaths over time for these countries 
1. per-capita death trajectories
    A. Compute the top 10 countries in terms of per-capita deaths from COVID-19
    B. Use Altair to plot the trajectory of the cumulative per-capita deaths over time for these countries
1. (Extra credit) Plot the trajectories of cumulative deaths over time for the top 30 countries in terms of total deaths. Add tooltips to show the country and the per-capita death rate at any time point, when the mouse is hovered over the point.
